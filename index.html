<p>Here you can find my programs written in Java. These programs have been written in my high school's AP Computer Science class to understand the fundamentals of the Java language. The Programs in my UNIX Folder include more advanced projects written in the UNIX command line interface, taking advantages of Makefiles for automating builds of programs, git for commiting changes, and Unit Testing to test specific parts of my code.</p>

<p>My projects in Mult-Media Logic include:</p>

<ul>
<li>2D-Array Sums: creates a grid of numbers 0-15 and finds the sum of the array the sum of each row, and the sum of each column</li>
<li>Adventure Game (CYOA): Create Your Own Adventure is a text based decision game. (Developed in UNIX environment).</li>
<li>Animal Inheritance: demonstrates my knowledge of java inheritance through different types of animals</li>
<li>Palindrome: checks to see of a given word is a Palindrome</li>
<li>String Sorter: puts strings in order</li>
<li>Password Database Simulator: demonstrates a simple login process with all possible passwords and usernames stored in arrays.</li>
<li>Unix Java Programs (Advanced Programs): More advanced programs I have created that were created in a UNIX command line environment. Makefiles are included. They allow automation of the building process. Programs are as follows:

<ul>
<li> Hello World: My first Program made in a command line environment and my first Makefile</li>
<li>Business Database Search: creates a database with provided text file. Sorts with Merge Sort and searches with Binary Search</li>
<li>Experimenting with git: This is a basic program I made that experiments committing changes to code using git</li>
<li>J Unit Testing: I created a Reverse Police notation (RPN) Calculator with a stack that is tested with J Unit.</li>
<li>Line-oriented text editor - Used linked list implement a line-oriented text editor</li>
<li>Binary Tree Implementer - My implementation of a binary search tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
