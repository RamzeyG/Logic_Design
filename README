# Logic_Deisgn
My experience with designing gate-level diagrams for modern computers

IMPORTANT:
In order to view these ".lgi" projects you must use a program called Multi-Media Logic. Please download the set up kit at the following link:

Xilinx ISE is used for Other Logic Design projects

I went ahead and Screen-shotted all my projects so you
do not need to download Mult-Media Logic or Xilinix ISE.
Each project has its own "Screenshot" folder.
